Fig. 1. Decomposition of anti-cartel penalties over training episodes using reward-based detection mechanism. Three penalty components are shown: Price Matching (detecting nearly identical prices between houses, δp=0.05), Low Variance (identifying suspiciously stable price patterns, δv=1e-4), and Correlation (measuring statistical correlation between house prices, δc=0.85). The horizontal line at 1.0€ indicates the boundary between normal and anomalous behavior. Vertical dashed lines mark when total penalties first exceed significant thresholds. Inset shows detailed view of a representative cartel detection event. Data is smoothed using a 150-episode moving average window.
