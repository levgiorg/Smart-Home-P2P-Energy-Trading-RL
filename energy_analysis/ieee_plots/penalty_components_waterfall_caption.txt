Fig. 2. Breakdown of average anti-cartel penalty components in reward-based detection mechanism. The chart shows the contribution of each component to the total penalty value: Price Matching (detecting identical price patterns), Low Variance (identifying suspiciously stable pricing), and Correlation (measuring statistical price correlation between houses). Values shown are averages across 7000 training episodes. Total penalty is the sum of all components and is applied as a negative reward during training.
